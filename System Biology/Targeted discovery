multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)
databases: NCBI (Gene, GEO), Ensembl, UniProt, TCGA, KEGG, Reactome, STRING.
Python
essential libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, biopython, gseapy, networkx.
R-
Bioconductor: DESeq2, clusterProfiler, limma, GEOquery, STRINGdb, RCytoscape.
Fetch gene information for a disease of interest from NCBI Gene using Entrez (Biopython or rentrez in R).


Public Omics Datasets
Retrieve and explore transcriptomics data from GEO/TCGA.
Use GEOquery (R) to download a small RNA-seq dataset (e.g., GSE123456) and extract expression matrix and phenotype.
TCGAbiolinks (R) or GDC API (Python) to fetch TCGA data for a cancer type.
Mini-project: Choose a disease, download a relevant expression dataset, and visualize sample groups.

Differential Expression & Functional Enrichment
Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and interpret via GO/KEGG.
Statistical principles of differential expression (DESeq2, limma).
Over-representation analysis (ORA) vs. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
Mini-project: Generate a report with top enriched pathways and candidate genes.

Pathway Analysis & Network Biology
Map DEGs onto pathways and build gene interaction networks.
Pathway databases: KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways.
Introduction to network biology: nodes, edges, centrality.
Use pathview (R) or gseapy to visualize KEGG pathways with DEGs highlighted.
Build a gene-gene interaction network using STRING (via STRINGdb R package or website export) for the top DEGs.
Import network into Cytoscape (desktop) and apply basic layout, style, and analyze hub genes.
Mini-project: Create a pathway figure and a network visualization for your disease.



Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks
 Deep dive into PPI databases and network analysis.

Multi-Omics Integration
Goal: Combine transcriptomics with proteomics or metabolomics data.
Tools: mixOmics (R), MOFA, or simple correlation approaches.
Create an integrated view of gene and protein expression for a few key pathways.


Literature Mining for Target Prioritization
Extract gene-disease associations and evidence from literature.
Generate a priority list of candidate targets with supporting literature counts.

Building Reproducible Pipelines
Snakemake or Nextflow
